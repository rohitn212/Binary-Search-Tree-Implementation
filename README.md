# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation
A binary search tree implementation I wrote for a school project.

This project taught me a lot about trees. I learnt how a heap can efficiently speed up the runtime for trees.

I have included a test file that tests each function I implemented. Download the files and run the makefile to test it.
